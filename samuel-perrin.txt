Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Inline elements like <a> and <span> are happy to sit on the same line as other elements, as long as there's room. Block elements like <div>, <p>, and <h1> by default don't share a line with other elements.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
An element that has position:absolute is positioned relative to its nearest positioned parent element, rather than to the viewport.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
Flexbox?

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
display block: <h1>, <div>, <p>
display inline: <a>, <span>
display inline-block: <button>

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
The box model treats elements as boxes, with three "frames" around the content. The innermost frame is the padding; the middle frame is the border, and the outermost frame is the margin. Padding can be thought of as the distance between the element's content and the border, while the margin is the distance between the border and other elements. The fix is the flexbox.
